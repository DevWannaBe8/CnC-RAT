# CnC-RAT
Remote Access Trojan (RAT) - Malicious Script

Description

This script is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allows unauthorized access to a victim's computer. Once executed, the RAT connects to a Command and Control (C&C) server and gives the attacker full control over the victim's system. It is capable of performing various actions such as keylogging, taking screenshots, uploading/downloading files, executing commands, and more. The script runs silently in the background, making it difficult for the victim to notice.

The victim will not see any visible signs of the attack, and the script will continue running even after a system reboot (on Windows systems).

Warning: This script is for educational purposes only. Do not use it for malicious purposes. Using this software without the explicit consent of the system owner is illegal and unethical. Please ensure that you follow the law and use this script responsibly.
Usage

    Customize the C&C server IP and port in the script to establish a connection.
    The script will attempt to connect to the specified server, and once connected, it will start listening for commands.
    The attacker can issue commands like keylogging, capturing screenshots, uploading/downloading files, and more.
