# CnC-RAT
Remote Access Trojan (RAT) - Malicious Script

Description

This script is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allows unauthorized access to a victim's computer. Once executed, the RAT connects to a Command and Control (C&C) server, giving the attacker full control over the victim's system. It is capable of performing various actions such as keylogging, taking screenshots, uploading/downloading files, executing commands, and more. The script runs silently in the background, making it difficult for the victim to notice.

Additionally, this RAT script has the capability to send stolen data (e.g., WiFi passwords, system info, etc.) directly to a Discord webhook, allowing the attacker to retrieve the data in real-time.

The victim will not see any visible signs of the attack, and the script will continue running even after a system reboot (on Windows systems).

Usage

    Customize the C&C server IP and port in the script to establish a connection.
    Set up a Discord webhook in the script to send sensitive data to a Discord channel (WiFi passwords, IP data, PC information, etc.).
    The script will attempt to connect to the C&C server, and once connected, it will start listening for commands.
    The attacker can issue commands such as keylogging, capturing screenshots, uploading/downloading files, and more.
    Any critical data (e.g., WiFi credentials, system info, etc.) will be sent to the specified Discord webhook in real-time.
